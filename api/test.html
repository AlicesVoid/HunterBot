                            <p><b>Saitama</b> is a human from Z-City who; through rigorous (sort of) training broke
                                through his human limiters and achieved unbelievable strength and abilities. Never
                                breaking a sweat, the name One Punch Man is fitting for the effortless wins Saitama has
                                achieved through the series. Never going beyond a simple brawl, his sheer strength,
                                speed, and sower have effortlessly mowed down anyone in his way.
                            </p>
                            <p>A parody character essentially; Saitama is a play on generic, flamboyant battle manga
                                protagonists, who struggle greatly to achieve victory against overly evil characters. He
                                breaks the trend through his lethargic and typically emotionless personality, combined
                                with massively overwhelming strength. Due to his effortless wins through the series, we
                                have yet to see his true, full capabilities; getting slightly more "serious" as the
                                series progresses, he casually puts down any new enemy on his radar.
